# Integrated-Robotic-Driver

A 3-month project, thoroughly documented in Google Docs, detailing the robotâ€™s reactions to color-coded commands and the mechanisms controlling its navigation and behavior.
This project involved creating a simulated robot using MATLAB and coded with Java. The robot navigated a color-coded course designed to simulate real-world scenarios:

* Red: Stop immediately.
* Blue: Slow down and simulate picking up passengers, mimicking a bus stop.
* Green: Stop completely, marking the end of the route.

The robot's journey involved picking up "passengers" at blue zones and transporting them to the green zone. The process also included programming arm control operations for tasks like turning corners and detecting walls to avoid collisions.
